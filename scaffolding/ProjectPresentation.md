### Introduction to EOTRH
Dental disease is a common yet frequently underdiagnosed condition in horses (Sidwell et al., 2024). This issue is particularly concerning due to the significant pain these pathologies can cause —comparable to that of colic (Coneglian et al., 2020)— and the increasing life expectancy of horses, which has contributed to a higher prevalence of dental disorders among geriatric equines (Welsh et al., 2016).

Among these diseases, EOTRH (*Equine Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption and Hypercementosis*) stands out as a progressive pathology that primarily affects the incisors and canines. First described by Klugh (2004) and later named by Staszyk et al. (2008), it is characterized by a sequential process of tooth resorption followed by irregular hypercementosis.

The disease initially targets the periodontium, leading to the degradation of dental tissue through the activity of odontoclasts, cementoclasts, and osteoclasts (Smedley et al., 2015). This destruction prompts a reparative response involving disorganized cementum deposits, resulting in bulbous enlargements of the affected teeth (Limone et al., 2020). Therefore, hypercementosis is considered a reparative response rather than a primary lesion (Smedley et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2017).

Although EOTRH most commonly involves the incisors and canines, it can also affect the cheek teeth (Moore et al., 2016). The condition predominantly occurs in horses over 15 years of age, although cases have been documented in animals as young as 10 (Rehrl et al., 2017). Numerous studies agree that the risk increases with age (Hole, 2012; Earley & Rawlinson, 2013; Rehrl et al., 2022). At present, extraction of the affected teeth remains the only effective treatment, as no curative therapy is currently available (Limone et al., 2020).

### Prevalence
The true prevalence of equine dental diseases in Spain, including EOTRH, remains unknown. However, international studies report a high radiographic prevalence of findings compatible with EOTRH. Rehrl et al. (2022) observed signs of the disease in 94% of incisors from 142 horses (aged 10–37) referred for dental evaluation, with all individuals over 14 showing some degree of radiological lesion. Similarly, Tretow et al. (2025) reported clinical and radiological signs in 67.5% and 72.2% of 151 horses over 15 years of age, respectively. In a recent survey done to equine veterinarians in Portugal, Siebert (2024) found that after viewing reference images, 66.7% of respondents (14 out of 21) recognized having encountered similar cases, suggesting that the disease may be more widespread than previously assumed.

### Etiology
Although the etiology of EOTRH remains unclear, the condition is widely believed to be multifactorial (Limone, 2020). One hypothesis suggests an immune-mediated mechanism, akin to idiopathic multiple root resorption in humans and feline odontoclastic resorption. In both scenarios, tooth resorption occurs, as seen in EOTRH (Staszyk et al., 2008). However, horses uniquely exhibit hypercementosis, distinguishing their presentation from that of other species (du Toit, 2023).

Alternative theories propose a periodontal inflammatory origin, potentially involving bacterial agents such as Treponema spp. and Tannerella spp. (Baratt, 2007). According to Staszyk et al., excessive masticatory stress on the periodontal ligaments in aging horses may act as a mechanical trigger, given their reduced ligament-to-occlusal surface ratio despite maintaining similar chewing forces (Górski et al., 2021).

Additional proposed factors include ischemic necrosis (Caldwell, 2007), genetic predispositions, systemic diseases (Reiter & Mendoza, 2002), dietary influences, and suboptimal dental interventions (Pearson et al., 2013).

### Clinical symptoms and lesions
Affected horses may be asymptomatic or show nonspecific signs when diagnosed. These include pain, masticatory difficulty, food rejection (*quidding*), hypersalivation, halitosis, bitting problems, head shaking, behavioral changes, hypersensitivity to the bit, periodic inappetence, and weight loss. In older horses, fractured or avulsed teeth may occur as a consequence of the resorptive disease. (Limone et al., 2020).

Findings during the oral examination typically include lesions such as enlargement of submandibular lymph nodes, loss of dental papillae, fistulae, severe inflammation with calculus accumulation, secretion and food debris, gingival recession or hyperplasia, bulbous dental enlargement, visible resorptive lesions, and damage beneath accumulated calculus (Smedley et al., 2020). (see below figures 1 and 2).

Prominent juga secondary to tooth expansion/extrusion may be present with or without associated draining tracts. As the disease progresses, additional clinical findings may include pulp exposure, advanced periodontal disease, bone disease, tooth mobility, fractures of the tooth or surrounding bone, or tooth loss (Limone et al., 2020).

Three distinct clinical manifestations of EOTRH have been described: a predominantly hyperplastic form, a predominantly resorptive form and a mixed form characterized by a combination of resorption and hypercementosis. (Smedley et al., 2015)

In this context, Tretow et al. (2025) describe a symptom complex indicative of EOTRH, consisting of: non-age correlating bite angle, bulbous enlargement of gingiva, gingival recession, fistulae and gingivitis.

**Figure 1 and 2:**  
Two distinct clinical cases of advanced EOTRH.  
Figure 1 shows severe gingival recession, bulbous dental enlargement, and significant inflammation with calculus covering the incisors.  
Figure 2 presents extensive necrotic lesions, visible fistulae, pulp exposure, and signs of tooth or bone fracture, accompanied by severe loss of soft tissue coverage.

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis of EOTRH relies on the identification of radiological signs in conjuction with clinical findings. (Hole & Staszyk, 2016). This topic is addressed in greater detail in the Materials and Methods section. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that extraoral and intraoral dental radiography remains the cornerstone of diagnosis (Lorello et al., 2014).

**Figure 3 and 4:**  
Radiographic signs of EOTRH illustrated in two different clinical cases. Figure 3 shows resorptive lesions in the reserve crown, root(s), or surrounding bone (a), hypercementosis of the reserve crown/root(s) (b), lysis of the periapical bone (e), areas of condensing osteitis or periapical alveolar bone sclerosis (f), and dental fractures (g).  
Figure 4 displays widening of the periodontal ligament space (c) and expansion of the alveolar bone (d), both consistent with advanced EOTRH manifestations described in the literature (Limone et al., 2020). *Images kindly provided by Sandra Fortuny, 2025 (figure 3) and Erik Ranobell, 2025 (figure 4).

### Treatment and prognosis
Management of EOTRH focuses on early recognition, radiographic diagnosis, ongoing monitoring, and client communication. Treatment of EOTRH is primarily symptomatic, with the aim of improving quality of life. In mild cases, conservative strategies—including analgesics, antibiotics, chlorhexidine rinses, and improved dental hygiene—may offer temporary relief but do not halt disease progression (Limone et al., 2020).

To date, extraction of affected teeth is the only definitive treatment once lesions become severe or painful (Foster, 2013; Lorello et al., 2016; Rahmani et al., 2019; Rawlinson & Earley, 2013). Although invasive, this approach has proven effective in reducing pain and improving the horse's well-being (Rainbow et al., 2023; Rahmani et al., 2019). Most horses recover well and are able to eat normally even without some or all of their incisors (Lorello et al., 2014).

The prognosis depends heavily on early detection. Although no effective preventive measures currently exist, regular radiographic screening is recommended in horses over 15 years old to identify early-stage lesions and plan timely interventions (Limone et al., 2020).

To support this objective, EOTRH Watch was developed as a tool to aid veterinarians in recognizing the disease in its initial stages and enhancing follow-up care.

## Objectives
Despite the growing awareness of EOTRH in central and northern Europe, there is currently no published data on this pathology in Spain. This gap in research and documentation suggests that EOTRH remains underrecognized in veterinary training, despite its severity, and that many cases may go undiagnosed and untreated. In fact, Sidwell et al. (2024) and Kennedy (2025) identified it as the most painful equine dental disease, based on both the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the Horse Grimace Scale (HGS). Nevertheless, a significant proportion of general practitioners are still unaware of its occurrence in older horses, often leading to prolonged, silent suffering that could be alleviated with timely identification.

The main objective of this work is to develop an innovative diagnostic support software, EOTRH Watch, designed to address these limitations. Specifically, the software will aim to:

1) Facilitate the early identification of EOTRH through a structured clinical and radiographical assesment,
2) support monitoring of disease progression in diagnosed horses,
3) enhace the visibility of EOTRH within the veterinary community, contributing to greater awareness and proactive clinical approaches and
4) implement cutting-edge radiographic image processing technology—used in human medicine—for the first time in equine veterinary software, opening up new diagnostic capabilities

A central feature of this project is also the creation of a tool that is universally applicable, making it accessible to all veterinary professionals—including field veterinarians, hospital-based clinicians, equine dental specialists, and general practitioners. By integrating scientific evidence with user-friendly technology, EOTRH Watch seeks to bridge the gap between research and clinical application.

Although EOTRH currently lacks a definitive cure, early detection is essential for making better-informed clinical decisions and effective pain management strategies. EOTRH Watch not only aids in this early diagnosis, but also empowers veterinarians with a new approach to a complex and often invisible disease—ultimately contributing to a significant improvement in the quality of life of affected horses.

## Materials and methods

### Software Identity and Visual Design
The name of the software directly reflects its primary objective: to support the detection and active watch over EOTRH while also bringing greater visibility to the condition.

### Rationale for the Clinical and Radiological Layers
Tretow et al. (2025) emphasize that it is the combination of clinical signs from the symptom complex—such as the presence of fistulae or an occlusal angle inconsistent with age—that should prompt radiographic examination to confirm the diagnosis of EOTRH.

The clinical layer of EOTRH Watch follows this logic. It incorporates a structured assessment grid to be completed by the veterinarian based on findings during the oral examination.

However, it is important to note that by the time clinical signs become apparent, radiographic lesions are often already advanced (Lorello et al., 2014; Górski et al., 2021; Sidwell et al., 2024). Therefore, the absence of clinical symptoms does not preclude the presence of EOTRH.

For this reason, to complement clinical evaluation, the software incorporates radiographic analysis.

To ensure consistency and diagnostic value, it is recommended that users acquire radiographs according to the methodology described by Rehrl et al. (2017), which includes three projections per patient using the Hemisphere positioning model: (1) a lateral view (90°/0°) for general assessment, (2) a dorsoventral intraoral oblique (0°/+45°) for evaluation of the maxillary incisors, and (3) a ventrodorsal intraoral oblique (0°/−80°) for the mandibular incisors. This protocol has also been endorsed by Tretow et al. (2025) as a robust standard for obtaining diagnostic-quality images of the incisors of a horse.

While two-dimensional radiographic imaging presents certain limitations in equine dentistry, computed tomography (CT) has been shown to complement and overcome many of these constraints. However, CT remains a costly diagnostic tool, typically limited to large referral centers, and is often contraindicated in the absence of general anesthesia (Manso‐Díaz et al., 2019). Consequently, standard radiography continues to be the recommended first-line imaging modality for evaluating incisor teeth in equine patients (Baratt, 2020).

In alignment with this clinical reality, EOTRH Watch is built upon interpretation of conventional radiographic images, rather than relying on advanced imaging technologies. The software has been specifically designed to be accessible for both veterinarians working in well-equipped facilities and those operating in field settings, ensuring broad applicability in everyday clinical practice.

However, several authors (Henry et al., 2017; Igel et al., 2023) have cautioned that early-stage radiographic lesions may reflect physiological changes and lack clinical relevance, particularly during subclinical phases. Therefore, radiographic findings should be interpreted in conjunction with the patient's clinical context.

### Technical Development and Framework
The software was developed in Python (version 3.10), utilizing Visual Studio Code as the primary development environment and GitHub for version control. The graphical user interface was created using Tkinter and PyQt5, while digital image processing relied on libraries such as OpenCV, Pillow, skimage, and EntropyHub.

### Diagnostic Layers and Workflow

The program features a modular main menu that initially displays a welcome screen with the software's name and logo. It then guides the user through three diagnostic layers: manual clinical assessment, automatic digital radiographic analysis, and manual radiographic evaluation.

Following the first layer—the manual clinical assessment—the program assigns the horse a clinical stage ranging from 0 to 4, based on the classification proposed by Tretow et al. (2025). If radiographs are available, the veterinarian can proceed with the radiographic analysis.

The program first prompts the user to perform the automatic digital radiographic analysis. Upon completion, it provides an interpretation of the findings as either "non-suspicious" or "suspicious of EOTRH," thereby supporting the veterinarian's diagnostic decision-making.

Subsequently, the user is asked whether they wish to conduct the manual radiographic evaluation. This step allows the software to assign a radiological stage from 0 to 4, in accordance with the staging system proposed by Tretow et al., (2025).

In the final window, the user receives the scores from all three diagnostic layers, along with tailored clinical recommendations for each stage.

### Explanation of the Functionality of Each Layer

#### Manual Clinical Assesment
The manual clinical assessment layer of EOTRH Watch is based on a clinical scoring chart adapted from the most recent and comprehensive study on the topic: Tretow et al. (2025) (see Figure 6). The chart incorporates the key elements of what the authors define as the "symptom complex", previously mentioned.

| Clinical Findings | Clinical Description | Score |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Fistulae | 1 purulent or up to 3 serous | 1 |
|  | 2–3 purulent or 4–6 serous | 2 |
|  | >3 purulent or >6 serous | 3 |
| Gingival recession | <1/3 of the root exposed | 1 |
|  | <2/3 of the root exposed | 2 |
|  | Whole root exposed | 3 |
| Subgingival bulbous enlargement | No | 0 |
|  | Yes | 1 |
| Gingivitis | Focal | 1 |
|  | Widespread | 2 |
|  | Blueish colour | 3 |
| Bite angle not correlated with age | 15 years and pincer-like* | 1 |
|  | Over 15 years old and bisection angle | 2 |
|  | Over 15 years old and pincer-like* | 3 |

*Pincer-like= large angle between the maxillary and mandibular corner incisors*

**Figure 6:**  
Manual clinical scoring chart used in EOTRH Watch, designed by the author based on the clinical criteria described by Tretow et al. (2025).

Following the conclusions of Tretow et al. (2025) two commonly observed signs—dental calculus and tooth mobility—were intentionally excluded from the scoring system. Although these findings may be secondary to EOTRH, the study determined that they are not particulary indicative of the disease, thus lacking diagnostic value.

Importantly, the scoring system not only considers the presence of clinical signs but also their severity. Therefore, the software integrates a severity-weighted scoring system aligned with that proposed in Tretow's study, enabling a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation.

As previously described, based on the total score obtained from the clinical assessment, the software assigns a clinical stage ranging from 0 to 4. Stage 1 is considered suspicious (1–2 points), Stage 2 corresponds to mild signs (3–5 points), Stage 3 reflects moderate involvement (6–9 points) and Stage 4 denotes severe clinical presentation (≥10 points), following the classification proposed by Tretow et al. (2025). For each stage, the software also provides a specific interpretive comment, tailored to the corresponding clinical score, developed through a review of recent literature (Lorello et al., 2014; Rahmani, 2019; Tretow et al., 2025) to support clinical decision-making (see Figure 7).

The interpretive comment serves both to describe the clinical stage and to indicate the necessity of radiographic assessment according to the severity of the observed clinical signs.

| Clinical Stage | Clinical Findings | Score | Interpretive Comment |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|---------------------|
| 0 | No findings, healthy | 0 | Clinical normality. Subclinical disease cannot be ruled out. Radiographic assesment is recommended in older horses (>20 years) |
| 1 | Suspicious | 1–2 | Minimal and non-specific signs. May be age-related. Clinical indicators such as gingival recession or gingivitis increasethe risk of underlying disease and should prompt further monitoring. Radiographic assesment is advised. |
| 2 | Mild | 3–5 | Presence of clear clinical signs but localized. Radiographic assesment is recommended to stage the lesions. |
| 3 | Moderate | 6–9 | Multiple clinical signs with moderate intensity. Suggestive of disease progression. Radiographic assesment is strongly recommended to evaluate lesion severity and progression. |
| 4 | Severe | ≥10 | Generalized and severe clinical involvement. Common findings include gingival swelling, fistulae, and bite angle not correlated with age. Radiological assessment is essential at this stage to accurately characterize lesion severity, as the extent of radiographic changes and associated pain may warrant extraction of the affected teeth. |

While alternative scoring systems were reviewed during the development phase—such as the clinical chart proposed by Albers et al. (2022)—the model by Tretow et al. was ultimately selected due to its focus on the correlation between clinical and radiographic findings, as well as its higher degree of recent validation and diagnostic accuracy

#### Automatic Radiographic Analysis
This layer is based on two core processes.

The first process involves the application of digital image filters (in this software, the filter Normalize) to improve brightness, contrast, and edge definition, thereby increasing the visual diagnostic value of the radiographs.

The second process applies dental texture analysis algorithms directly to intraoral images. Originally developed for human dentistry, these methods were first adapted to equine radiology by Górski et al. (2022), who conducted studies validating their utility in the detection of EOTRH-related changes.

The authors investigated the application of two-dimensional entropy analysis—an emerging technique that quantifies the irregularity and complexity of radiographic textures—as a tool to improve the detection of EOTRH-related lesions. Among the entropy-based metrics evaluated, only the extraction of the entropy measure DistEn2D values from radiographs processed with the Normalize filter demonstrated clear EOTRH grade–related differences, suggesting its potential for integration into advanced veterinary diagnostic protocols for incisor disorders.

Although this digital radiograph processing method effectively identifies radiological features corresponding to all EOTRH grades, its discriminatory power between adjacent stages—such as between EOTRH 0 and 1, or 2 and 3—is limited. For this reason, its utility lies in early detection and screening, rather than in precise radiographic staging.

The automatic layer begins by allowing users to upload a radiographic image, which is then automatically normalized using the Normalize filter from the SimpleITK toolkit in Python. Due to the limitations of entropy-based processing on full images, the analysis must be restricted to specific regions of interest (ROIs), that are manually selected.

The ROIs to be selected are the first upper right incisor (tooth 101) and the first upper left incisor (tooth 201), according to the modified Triadan system for equine dental nomenclature. These central maxillary incisors provide optimal visualization in dorsoventral projections and are less affected by superimposition from surrounding tissues (Górski et al., 2022). On each selected incisor, the ROI should be defined according to the guidelines provided in Górski's study: "Each ROI covers the largest possible area of the tooth crown and the largest possible area of the tooth root," and is delimited by four high-radiodensity borders.

Once the ROIs are established, the software calculates DistEn2D values using the EntropyHub library. The resulting values are interpreted in accordance with the findings of Górski et al. (2022).

The software simplifies the output into two diagnostic categories: non-suspicious and suspicious for EOTRH. However, it includes an interpretative note to guide the clinician: "The classification into 'suspicious' or 'non-suspicious' is intended to support, not replace, the clinical and radiographic evaluation performed by a trained veterinarian. It should therefore always be interpreted within the context of a comprehensive diagnostic assessment.".

To define the threshold between these two categories, the study's performance metrics were evaluated across multiple cutoff strategies. The most balanced and reliable choice was the mean threshold, established at DistEn2D = 0.65. This value serves as the current reference point within the software, but it can be dynamically updated in future iterations as additional data are incorporated and a local reference dataset is built.

#### Manual Radiographic Evaluation
The manual radiographic evaluation layer is based on the most current and validated radiographic classification systems available for EOTRH diagnosis (see Figure 8). This assessment relies on intraoral digital projections, as previously described, and follows the staging criteria originally proposed by Hüls et al. (2012), later refined by Rehrl et al. (2023), and implemented in the study by Tretow et al. (2025). The classification system demonstrated significant diagnostic utility in Tretow's study, where it enabled the identification of radiographic evidence of EOTRH in 72.2% of the horses evaluated. These findings support its integration into standardized diagnostic protocols.

| Radiological Findings | Description | Score |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------|
| Quantity: Teeth Affected | 0 | 0 |
|  | 1–4 | 1 |
|  | 5–8 | 2 |
|  | ≥9 | 3 |
| Quantity: Missing/Extracted teeth | None | 0 |
|  | One or more incisors already missing/extracted | 1 |
| Tooth Shape | Regular | 0 |
|  | Preserved: slightly blunted root tip, enlargement of the periodontal space | 1 |
|  | Largely preserved: circumferential increase of the root tip or the more occlusal part of the tooth, intra-alveolar tooth part < clinical crown | 2 |
|  | Largely lost: intra-alveolar tooth part = clinical crown | 3 |
|  | Lost: intra-alveolar tooth part > clinical crown | 4 |
| Tooth Structure | No radiological findings | 0 |
|  | Mild: single area of increased radiolucency (up to max. 1/3 of the root width) | 1 |
|  | Moderate: multiple areas of increased radiolucency (up to max. 1/3) or two (up to 2/3) | 2 |
|  | Severe: large areas of increased radiolucency | 3 |
| Tooth Surface | No radiological findings | 0 |
|  | 1 irregularity (up to max 1/3 root length) | 1 |
|  | 2 irregularities/surface rough | 2 |
|  | Obviously irregular (surface slumps)/ rough | 3 |

**Figure 8:**  
Radiological scoring chart used in EOTRH Detect, adopted from Tretow et al. (2025) and designed by the author.

| Stage | Score | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Normal | 0 | No abnormal radiological findings. However, the first pathological changes may begin on the palatal/lingual side and may not yet be visible. In older horses or in the presence of clinical signs, periodic radiographic monitoring is advised. |
| Suspicious | 1–2 | Tooth shape preserved but sporadic deviations: slightly blunted root tip, surface irregular/rough, slightly altered tooth structure. Continued radiographic monitoring and clinical evaluations are recommended. |
| Mild | 2–5 | Tooth shape preserved, slightly blunted root tip, surface irregular/rough, slightly altered tooth structure. Extraction is not usually needed at this stage but regular monitoring is essential to assess structural changes or progression. Measuring gingival recession can help track disease progression. |
| Moderate | 6–9 | Tooth shape largely preserved, intra-alveolar tooth part is not wider than the clinical crown, obviously blunted root tip, surface irregular/rough, moderately altered tooth structure. Treatment planning should include follow-up radiographs and may require extraction of teeth that are painful, nonvital, or structurally compromised. |
| Severe | ≥10 | Loss of tooth shape, intra-alveolar tooth part is wider than the clinical crown, surface obviously irregular/rough, severely altered tooth structure. Extraction is often recommended, specially once supragingival lesions, alveolitis, osteomyelitis, tooth fractures, and extensive resorption of the reserve crown and root are detectable radiographically. The decision should be based on the veterinarian's clinical judgment, integrating both radiographic and clinical findings, with particular attention to a thorough dental pain assessment. Incisor extraction, when indicated, has a favorable prognosis and can significantly improve the horse's welfare. |

Nonetheless, as highlighted by previous research (Henry et al., 2017; Igel et al., 2023), mild or early-stage radiographic changes—particularly in geriatric horses—may reflect physiological rather than pathological processes. In recognition of this limitation, EOTRH Detect incorporates contextual interpretative notes when Stage 1 or 2 findings are recorded. These prompts are intended to encourage cautious interpretation.

### Interpretation of Diagnostic Output
The final interpretation of the diagnostic results is left to the user, who is responsible for integrating the information from the three layers along with the clinical recommendations to establish a final diagnostic stage and clinical plan.

The software does not generate a definitive diagnosis on its own, as there is currently no scientific evidence supporting the relative weight that each diagnostic layer should carry. Specifically, the contribution of clinical and radiographic signs to an overall diagnosis has not been quantitatively validated. Furthermore, the automatic digital analysis is a novel tool that requires interpretation by a trained professional who understands its limitations.

Automatically assigning a final diagnosis without this contextual clinical judgment would not be scientifically accurate and could potentially lead to misdiagnoses. For this reason, the software is designed as a decision-support tool that compiles and organizes all relevant diagnostic information, thereby assisting the veterinarian in making a well-informed final decision.

## Results and discussion

### Overview and Clinical Relevance
The development of EOTRH Watch has resulted in a functional and structured diagnostic software capable of guiding veterinarians through three key layers: clinical assessment, radiographic interpretation, and automatic image analysis. This platform responds to a pressing clinical need for standardized, early, and evidence-based detection of Equine Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption and Hypercementosis (EOTRH.

### Performance of Automatic Diagnostic Layer
The successful implementation of an automated analysis layer using two-dimensional entropy metrics (particularly DistEn2D) marks a promising step forward in the integration of digital imaging techniques within equine dentistry.

### Limitations and Challenges Encountered
Despite these advances, several limitations emerged during development. Technically, the software was developed by the author with no prior programming experience, which required a steep learning curve. Methodologically, the automatic layer initially returned entropy values that were highly variable and poorly discriminative. These issues were partially resolved by standardizing the size of rectangular ROIs (128×128 pixels) and incorporating normalization steps. Although a polygonal ROI option was later implemented to improve clinical relevance, it did not significantly enhance interpretive accuracy.

To address the technical and analytical limitations encountered in the development of the automated layer the author sought the collaboration of an expert in biomedical image analysis. This partnership provided essential expertise that helped refine the analytical workflow and enhance the scientific validity and reliability of the final version of the software.

In terms of data reliability, the effectiveness of the automated layer remains constrained by the size and diversity of the dataset. A preliminary set of radiographs was collected with the generous collaboration of several veterinarians: Dr. Sandra Fortuny, Dr. Erik Ranobell, Dr. José María Galafate, Dr. Manuel Novales, Dr. Inés Santos, and Dr. Constanza Mora. However, further validation using a broader and more representative sample is essential. Continued clinical application and the contribution of new cases will be critical to refining the diagnostic accuracy of the tool.

The manual clinical assessment layer has proven functional, although it tends to overestimate disease severity in geriatric horses due to age-related changes such as gingival recession. To improve diagnostic specificity, it may be beneficial to assign greater weight to advanced inflammatory signs—such as fistulae, gingival bleeding, or marked recession—as suggested by Tretow et al. (2025). However, this adjustment was not implemented in the current version, as it would have significantly increased the complexity of the software development process.

The limitations observed in the radiographic layer of EOTRH Watch reflect broader systemic gaps in equine veterinary dentistry, particularly concerning diagnostic frameworks. Existing radiological classification systems were primarily designed for brachydont species and do not adequately capture the morphological and pathological complexity of equine dentition (Albers et al., 2022, 2023). This highlights the pressing need for an equine-specific catalogue of radiographic findings—one that addresses not only resorptive lesions but also structural alterations related to hypercementosis. Without such a validated system, early-stage differentiation between pathological and age-related changes remains both clinically challenging and prone to misinterpretation.

Introduction to EOTRH
Dental disease is a common yet frequently underdiagnosed condition in horses (Sidwell
et al., 2024). This issue is particularly concerning due to the significant pain these
pathologies can cause —comparable to that of colic (Coneglian et al., 2020)— and the
increasing life expectancy of horses, which has contributed to a higher prevalence of
dental disorders among geriatric equines (Welsh et al., 2016).
Among these diseases, EOTRH ( Equine Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption and
Hypercementosis ) stands out as a progressive pathology that primarily affects the incisors
and canines. First described by Klugh (2004) and later named by Staszyk et al. (2008), it
is characterized by a sequential process of tooth resorption followed by irregular
hypercementosis.
The disease initially targets the periodontium, leading to the degradation of dental tissue
through the activity of odontoclasts, cementoclasts, and osteoclasts (Smedley et al.,
2015). This destruction prompts a reparative response involving disorganized cementum
deposits, resulting in bulbous enlargements of the affected teeth (Limone et al., 2020).
Therefore, hypercementosis is considered a reparative response rather than a primary
lesion (Smedley et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2017).
Although EOTRH most commonly involves the incisors and canines, it can also affect
the cheek teeth (Moore et al., 2016). The condition predominantly occurs in horses over
15 years of age, although cases have been documented in animals as young as 10 (Rehrl
et al., 2017). Numerous studies agree that the risk increases with age (Hole, 2012; Earley
& Rawlinson, 2013; Rehrl et al., 2022). At present, extraction of the affected teeth remains
the only effective treatment, as no curative therapy is currently available (Limone et al.,
2020).
Prevalence
The true prevalence of equine dental diseases in Spain, including EOTRH, remains
unknown. However, international studies report a high radiographic prevalence of
findings compatible with EOTRH. Rehrl et al. (2022) observed signs of the disease in
94% of incisors from 142 horses (aged 10–37) referred for dental evaluation, with all
individuals over 14 showing some degree of radiological lesion. Similarly, Tretow et al.
(2025) reported clinical and radiological signs in 67.5% and 72.2% of 151 horses over 15
years of age, respectively. In a recent survey done to equine veterinarians in Portugal,
Siebert (2024) found that after viewing reference images, 66.7% of respondents (14 out
of 21) recognized having encountered similar cases, suggesting that the disease may be
more widespread than previously assumed.
Etiology
Although the etiology of EOTRH remains unclear, the condition is widely believed to be
multifactorial (Limone, 2020). One hypothesis suggests an immune-mediated
mechanism, akin to idiopathic multiple root resorption in humans and feline odontoclastic
resorption. In both scenarios, tooth resorption occurs, as seen in EOTRH (Staszyk et al.,
2008). However, horses uniquely exhibit hypercementosis, distinguishing their
presentation from that of other species (du Toit, 2023).
Alternative theories propose a periodontal inflammatory origin, potentially involving
bacterial agents such as Treponema spp. and Tannerella spp. (Baratt, 2007). According to

Staszyk et al., excessive masticatory stress on the periodontal ligaments in aging horses
may act as a mechanical trigger, given their reduced ligament-to-occlusal surface ratio
despite maintaining similar chewing forces (Górski et al., 2021).
Additional proposed factors include ischemic necrosis (Caldwell, 2007), genetic
predispositions, systemic diseases (Reiter & Mendoza, 2002), dietary influences, and
suboptimal dental interventions (Pearson et al., 2013).
Clinical symptoms and lesions
Affected horses may be asymptomatic or show nonspecific signs when diagnosed. These
include pain, masticatory difficulty, food rejection ( quidding ), hypersalivation, halitosis,
bitting problems, head shaking, behavioral changes, hypersensitivity to the bit, periodic
inappetence, and weight loss. In older horses, fractured or avulsed teeth may occur as a
consequence of the resorptive disease. (Limone et al., 2020).
Findings during the oral examination typically include lesions such as enlargement of
submandibular lymph nodes, loss of dental papillae, fistulae, severe inflammation with
calculus accumulation, secretion and food debris, gingival recession or hyperplasia,
bulbous dental enlargement, visible resorptive lesions, and damage beneath accumulated
calculus (Smedley et al., 2020). (see below figures 1 and 2).
Prominent juga secondary to tooth expansion/extrusion may be present with or without
associated draining tracts. As the disease progresses, additional clinical findings may
include pulp exposure, advanced periodontal disease, bone disease, tooth mobility,
fractures of the tooth or surrounding bone, or tooth loss (Limone et al., 2020).
Three distinct clinical manifestations of EOTRH have been described: a predominantly
hyperplastic form, a predominantly resorptive form and a mixed form characterized by a
combination of resorption and hypercementosis. (Smedley et al., 2015)
In this context, Tretow et al. (2025) describe a symptom complex indicative of EOTRH,
consisting of: non-age correlating bite angle, bulbous enlargement of gingiva, gingival
recession, fistulae and gingivitis.

lesions, visible fistulae, pulp exposure,

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of EOTRH relies on the identification of radiological signs in conjuction with
clinical findings. (Hole & Staszyk, 2016). This topic is addressed in greater detail in the
Materials and Methods section. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that extraoral

and intraoral dental radiography remains the cornerstone of diagnosis (Lorello et al.,
2014).

Treatment and prognosis
Management of EOTRH focuses on early recognition, radiographic diagnosis, ongoing
monitoring, and client communication. Treatment of EOTRH is primarily symptomatic,
with the aim of improving quality of life. In mild cases, conservative strategies—
including analgesics, antibiotics, chlorhexidine rinses, and improved dental hygiene—
may offer temporary relief but do not halt disease progression (Limone et al., 2020).
To date, extraction of affected teeth is the only definitive treatment once lesions become
severe or painful (Foster, 2013; Lorello et al., 2016; Rahmani et al., 2019; Rawlinson &
Earley, 2013). Although invasive, this approach has proven effective in reducing pain and
improving the horse’s well-being (Rainbow et al., 2023; Rahmani et al., 2019). Most
horses recover well and are able to eat normally even without some or all of their incisors
(Lorello et al., 2014).
The prognosis depends heavily on early detection. Although no effective preventive
measures currently exist, regular radiographic screening is recommended in horses over
15 years old to identify early-stage lesions and plan timely interventions (Limone et al.,
2020).
To support this objective, EOTRH Watch was developed as a tool to aid veterinarians in
recognizing the disease in its initial stages and enhancing follow-up care.

Objectives
Despite the growing awareness of EOTRH in central and northern Europe, there is
currently no published data on this pathology in Spain. This gap in research and
documentation suggests that EOTRH remains underrecognized in veterinary training,
despite its severity, and that many cases may go undiagnosed and untreated. In fact,
Sidwell et al. (2024) and Kennedy (2025) identified it as the most painful equine dental
disease, based on both the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the Horse Grimace Scale
(HGS). Nevertheless, a significant proportion of general practitioners are still unaware of
its occurrence in older horses, often leading to prolonged, silent suffering that could be
alleviated with timely identification.
The main objective of this work is to develop an innovative diagnostic support software,
EOTRH Watch, designed to address these limitations. Specifically, the software will aim
to:
1) Facilitate the early identification of EOTRH through a structured clinical and
radiographical assesment,
2) support monitoring of disease progression in diagnosed horses,
3) enhace the visibility of EOTRH within the veterinary community, contributing to
greater awareness and proactive clinical approaches and
4) implement cutting-edge radiographic image processing technology—used in
human medicine—for the first time in equine veterinary software, opening up new
diagnostic capabilities
A central feature of this project is also the creation of a tool that is universally applicable,
making it accessible to all veterinary professionals—including field veterinarians,
hospital-based clinicians, equine dental specialists, and general practitioners. By
integrating scientific evidence with user-friendly technology, EOTRH Watch seeks to
bridge the gap between research and clinical application.
Although EOTRH currently lacks a definitive cure, early detection is essential for making
better-informed clinical decisions and effective pain management strategies. EOTRH
Watch not only aids in this early diagnosis, but also empowers veterinarians with a new
approach to a complex and often invisible disease—ultimately contributing to a
significant improvement in the quality of life of affected horses.

welfare values.
Rationale for the Clinical and Radiological Layers
Tretow et al. (2025) emphasize that it is the combination of clinical signs from the
symptom complex—such as the presence of fistulae or an occlusal angle inconsistent with
age—that should prompt radiographic examination to confirm the diagnosis of EOTRH.
The clinical layer of EOTRH Watch follows this logic. It incorporates a structured
assessment grid to be completed by the veterinarian based on findings during the oral
examination.
However, it is important to note that by the time clinical signs become apparent,
radiographic lesions are often already advanced (Lorello et al., 2014; Górski et al., 2021;
Sidwell et al., 2024). Therefore, the absence of clinical symptoms does not preclude the
presence of EOTRH.
For this reason, to complement clinical evaluation, the software incorporates radiographic
analysis.
To ensure consistency and diagnostic value, it is recommended that users acquire
radiographs according to the methodology described by Rehrl et al. (2017), which
includes three projections per patient using the Hemisphere positioning model: (1) a
lateral view (90°/0°) for general assessment, (2) a dorsoventral intraoral oblique (0°/+45°)
for evaluation of the maxillary incisors, and (3) a ventrodorsal intraoral oblique (0°/−80°)
for the mandibular incisors. This protocol has also been endorsed by Tretow et al. (2025)
as a robust standard for obtaining diagnostic-quality images of the incisors of a horse.
While two-dimensional radiographic imaging presents certain limitations in equine
dentistry, computed tomography (CT) has been shown to complement and overcome
many of these constraints. However, CT remains a costly diagnostic tool, typically limited
to large referral centers, and is often contraindicated in the absence of general anesthesia
(Manso‐Díaz et al., 2019). Consequently, standard radiography continues to be the
recommended first-line imaging modality for evaluating incisor teeth in equine patients
(Baratt, 2020).
In alignment with this clinical reality, EOTRH Watch is built upon interpretation of
conventional radiographic images, rather than relying on advanced imaging technologies.
The software has been specifically designed to be accessible for both veterinarians
working in well-equipped facilities and those operating in field settings, ensuring broad
applicability in everyday clinical practice.
However, several authors (Henry et al., 2017; Igel et al., 2023) have cautioned that earlystage radiographic lesions may reflect physiological changes and lack clinical relevance,
particularly during subclinical phases. Therefore, radiographic findings should be
interpreted in conjunction with the patient’s clinical context.
Technical Development and Framework
The software was developed in Python (version 3.10), utilizing Visual Studio Code as the
primary development environment and GitHub for version control. The graphical user
interface was created using Tkinter and PyQt5, while digital image processing relied on
libraries such as OpenCV, Pillow, skimage, and EntropyHub.
Diagnostic Layers and Workflow

The program features a modular main menu that initially displays a welcome screen with
the software’s name and logo. It then guides the user through three diagnostic layers:
manual clinical assessment, automatic digital radiographic analysis, and manual
radiographic evaluation.
Following the first layer—the manual clinical assessment—the program assigns the horse
a clinical stage ranging from 0 to 4, based on the classification proposed by Tretow et al.
(2025). If radiographs are available, the veterinarian can proceed with the radiographic
analysis.
The program first prompts the user to perform the automatic digital radiographic analysis.
Upon completion, it provides an interpretation of the findings as either “non-suspicious”
or “suspicious of EOTRH,” thereby supporting the veterinarian’s diagnostic decisionmaking.
Subsequently, the user is asked whether they wish to conduct the manual radiographic
evaluation. This step allows the software to assign a radiological stage from 0 to 4, in
accordance with the staging system proposed by Tretow et al., (2025).
In the final window, the user receives the scores from all three diagnostic layers, along
with tailored clinical recommendations for each stage.
Explanation of the Functionality of Each Layer
Manual Clinical Assesment
The manual clinical assessment layer of EOTRH Watch is based on a clinical scoring chart
adapted from the most recent and comprehensive study on the topic: Tretow et al. (2025)
(see Figure 6). The chart incorporates the key elements of what the authors define as the
"symptom complex”, previously mentioned.

Figure 6:
Manual clinical scoring chart used in EOTRH Watch,
designed by the author based on the clinical criteria
described by Tretow et al. (2025).

Following the conclusions of Tretow
et al. (2025) two commonly observed
signs—dental calculus and tooth
mobility—were
intentionally
excluded from the scoring system.
Although these findings may be
secondary to EOTRH, the study
determined that they are not
particulary indicative of the disease,
thus lacking diagnostic value.

Importantly, the scoring system not only considers the presence of clinical signs but also
their severity. Therefore, the software integrates a severity-weighted scoring system
aligned with that proposed in Tretow’s study, enabling a more nuanced and clinically
meaningful evaluation.
As previously described, based on the total score obtained from the clinical assessment,
the software assigns a clinical stage ranging from 0 to 4. Stage 1 is considered suspicious
(1–2 points), Stage 2 corresponds to mild signs (3–5 points), Stage 3 reflects moderate

involvement (6–9 points) and Stage 4 denotes severe clinical presentation (≥10 points),
following the classification proposed by Tretow et al. (2025). For each stage, the
software also provides a specific interpretive comment, tailored to the corresponding
clinical score, developed through a review of recent literature (Lorello et al., 2014;
Rahmani, 2019; Tretow et al., 2025) to support clinical decision-making (see Figure 7).
The interpretive comment serves both to describe the clinical stage and to indicate the
necessity of radiographic assessment according to the severity of the observed clinical
signs.

Designed by the author, the table is adapted from Tretow et al. (2025).

While alternative scoring systems were reviewed during the development phase—such
as the clinical chart proposed by Albers et al. (2022)—the model by Tretow et al. was
ultimately selected due to its focus on the correlation between clinical and radiographic
findings, as well as its higher degree of recent validation and diagnostic accuracy
Automatic Radiographic Analysis
This layer is based on two core processes.
The first process involves the application of digital image filters (in this software, the
filter Normalize) to improve brightness, contrast, and edge definition, thereby increasing
the visual diagnostic value of the radiographs.
The second process applies dental texture analysis algorithms directly to intraoral images.
Originally developed for human dentistry, these methods were first adapted to equine
radiology by Górski et al. (2022), who conducted studies validating their utility in the
detection of EOTRH-related changes.
The authors investigated the application of two-dimensional entropy analysis—an
emerging technique that quantifies the irregularity and complexity of radiographic
textures—as a tool to improve the detection of EOTRH-related lesions. Among the
entropy-based metrics evaluated, only the extraction of the entropy measure DistEn2D
values from radiographs processed with the Normalize filter demonstrated clear EOTRH
grade–related differences, suggesting its potential for integration into advanced veterinary
diagnostic protocols for incisor disorders.
Although this digital radiograph processing method effectively identifies radiological
features corresponding to all EOTRH grades, its discriminatory power between adjacent

stages—such as between EOTRH 0 and 1, or 2 and 3—is limited. For this reason, its
utility lies in early detection and screening, rather than in precise radiographic staging.
The automatic layer begins by allowing users to upload a radiographic image, which is
then automatically normalized using the Normalize filter from the SimpleITK toolkit in
Python. Due to the limitations of entropy-based processing on full images, the analysis
must be restricted to specific regions of interest (ROIs), that are manually selected.
The ROIs to be selected are the first upper right incisor (tooth 101) and the first upper left
incisor (tooth 201), according to the modified Triadan system for equine dental
nomenclature. These central maxillary incisors provide optimal visualization in
dorsoventral projections and are less affected by superimposition from surrounding
tissues (Górski et al., 2022). On each selected incisor, the ROI should be defined
according to the guidelines provided in Górski’s study: “Each ROI covers the largest
possible area of the tooth crown and the largest possible area of the tooth root,” and is
delimited by four high-radiodensity borders.
Once the ROIs are established, the software calculates DistEn2D values using the
EntropyHub library. The resulting values are interpreted in accordance with the findings
of Górski et al. (2022).
The software simplifies the output into two diagnostic categories: non-suspicious and
suspicious for EOTRH. However, it includes an interpretative note to guide the clinician:
“The classification into ‘suspicious’ or ‘non-suspicious’ is intended to support, not
replace, the clinical and radiographic evaluation performed by a trained veterinarian. It
should therefore always be interpreted within the context of a comprehensive diagnostic
assessment.”.
To define the threshold between these two categories, the study’s performance metrics
were evaluated across multiple cutoff strategies. The most balanced and reliable choice
was the mean threshold, established at DistEn2D = 0.65. This value serves as the current
reference point within the software, but it can be dynamically updated in future iterations
as additional data are incorporated and a local reference dataset is built.
Manual Radiographic Evaluation
The manual radiographic evaluation layer is based on the most current and validated
radiographic classification systems available for EOTRH diagnosis (see Figure 8). This
assessment relies on intraoral digital projections, as previously described, and follows the
staging criteria originally proposed by Hüls et al. (2012), later refined by Rehrl et al.
(2023), and implemented in the study by Tretow et al. (2025). The classification system
demonstrated significant diagnostic utility in Tretow’s study, where it enabled the
identification of radiographic evidence of EOTRH in 72.2% of the horses evaluated.
These findings support its integration into standardized diagnostic protocols.

No abnormal radiological findings. However, the first pathological

radiographic monitoring is advised.
Tooth shape preserved but sporadic deviations: slightly blunted root
tip, surface irregular/rough, slightly altered tooth structure. Continued
radiographic monitoring and clinical evaluations are recommended.
Tooth shape preserved, slightly blunted root tip, surface
irregular/rough, slightly altered tooth structure. Extraction is not
usually needed at this stage but regular monitoring is essential to
assess structural changes or progression. Measuring gingival recession
can help track disease progression.
Tooth shape largely preserved, intra-alveolar tooth part is not wider
than the clinical crown, obviously blunted root tip, surface
irregular/rough, moderately altered tooth structure. Treatment
planning should include follow-up radiographs and may require
extraction of teeth that are painful, nonvital, or structurally
compromised.
Loss of tooth shape, intra-alveolar tooth part is wider than the clinical
crown, surface obviously irregular/rough, severely altered tooth
structure. Extraction is often recommended, specially once
supragingival lesions, alveolitis, osteomyelitis, tooth fractures, and
extensive resorption of the reserve crown and root are detectable
radiographically. The decision should be based on the veterinarian’s
clinical judgment, integrating both radiographic and clinical findings,
with particular attention to a thorough dental pain assessment. Incisor
extraction, when indicated, has a favorable prognosis and can
significantly improve the horse’s welfare.

framework proposed by Tretow et al. (2025)

Nonetheless, as highlighted by previous research (Henry et al., 2017; Igel et al., 2023),
mild or early-stage radiographic changes—particularly in geriatric horses—may reflect
physiological rather than pathological processes. In recognition of this limitation, EOTRH
Detect incorporates contextual interpretative notes when Stage 1 or 2 findings are
recorded. These prompts are intended to encourage cautious interpretation.
Interpretation of Diagnostic Output
The final interpretation of the diagnostic results is left to the user, who is responsible for
integrating the information from the three layers along with the clinical recommendations
to establish a final diagnostic stage and clinical plan.

The software does not generate a definitive diagnosis on its own, as there is currently no
scientific evidence supporting the relative weight that each diagnostic layer should carry.
Specifically, the contribution of clinical and radiographic signs to an overall diagnosis
has not been quantitatively validated. Furthermore, the automatic digital analysis is a
novel tool that requires interpretation by a trained professional who understands its
limitations.
Automatically assigning a final diagnosis without this contextual clinical judgment would
not be scientifically accurate and could potentially lead to misdiagnoses. For this reason,
the software is designed as a decision-support tool that compiles and organizes all relevant
diagnostic information, thereby assisting the veterinarian in making a well-informed final
decision.

Results and discussion
Overview and Clinical Relevance
The development of EOTRH Watch has resulted in a functional and structured diagnostic
software capable of guiding veterinarians through three key layers: clinical assessment,
radiographic interpretation, and automatic image analysis. This platform responds to a
pressing clinical need for standardized, early, and evidence-based detection of Equine
Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption and Hypercementosis (EOTRH.
Performance of Automatic Diagnostic Layer
The successful implementation of an automated analysis layer using two-dimensional
entropy metrics (particularly DistEn2D) marks a promising step forward in the integration
of digital imaging techniques within equine dentistry.
Limitations and Challenges Encountered
Despite these advances, several limitations emerged during development. Technically, the
software was developed by the author with no prior programming experience, which
required a steep learning curve. Methodologically, the automatic layer initially returned
entropy values that were highly variable and poorly discriminative. These issues were
partially resolved by standardizing the size of rectangular ROIs (128×128 pixels) and
incorporating normalization steps. Although a polygonal ROI option was later
implemented to improve clinical relevance, it did not significantly enhance interpretive
accuracy.
To address the technical and analytical limitations encountered in the development of the
automated layer the author sought the collaboration of an expert in biomedical image
analysis. This partnership provided essential expertise that helped refine the analytical
workflow and enhance the scientific validity and reliability of the final version of the
software.
In terms of data reliability, the effectiveness of the automated layer remains constrained
by the size and diversity of the dataset. A preliminary set of radiographs was collected
with the generous collaboration of several veterinarians: Dr. Sandra Fortuny, Dr. Erik
Ranobell, Dr. José María Galafate, Dr. Manuel Novales, Dr. Inés Santos, and Dr.
Constanza Mora. However, further validation using a broader and more representative

sample is essential. Continued clinical application and the contribution of new cases will
be critical to refining the diagnostic accuracy of the tool.
The manual clinical assessment layer has proven functional, although it tends to
overestimate disease severity in geriatric horses due to age-related changes such as
gingival recession. To improve diagnostic specificity, it may be beneficial to assign
greater weight to advanced inflammatory signs—such as fistulae, gingival bleeding, or
marked recession—as suggested by Tretow et al. (2025). However, this adjustment was
not implemented in the current version, as it would have significantly increased the
complexity of the software development process.
The limitations observed in the radiographic layer of EOTRH Watch reflect broader
systemic gaps in equine veterinary dentistry, particularly concerning diagnostic
frameworks. Existing radiological classification systems were primarily designed for
brachydont species and do not adequately capture the morphological and pathological
complexity of equine dentition (Albers et al., 2022, 2023). This highlights the pressing
need for an equine-specific catalogue of radiographic findings—one that addresses not
only resorptive lesions but also structural alterations related to hypercementosis. Without
such a validated system, early-stage differentiation between pathological and age-related
changes remains both clinically challenging and prone to misinterpretation.
This diagnostic ambiguity is particularly evident in the manual radiographic assessment
layer. Mild EOTRH-like changes, for example, have been observed radiographically in
all horses over 14 years of age (Rehrl et al., 2017), suggesting that certain features
currently interpreted as pathological may, in fact, reflect normal aging. This overlap calls
for refined staging systems grounded in longitudinal studies and population-level data.
To complement radiographic findings, the routine monitoring of gingival recession has
been proposed as a practical clinical tool to support early detection in cases where
radiographic evidence is ambiguous (Siebert, 2024).
In addition, the manual radiographic layer has another limitation that lies in the absence
of a standardized guide for determining when tooth extraction is indicated. As noted by
Siebert (2024), there is still no universally accepted clinical protocol that clearly defines
extraction thresholds based on radiographic findings. If such a guideline were available,
the software could provide more direct and definitive treatment recommendations
following the radiographic evaluation.
In its current form, however, EOTRH Watch cannot replace clinical judgment; instead, it
is designed to support the veterinarian, who must integrate information from both the
clinical and radiographic assessments to determine the most appropriate treatment plan
for each case. Nevertheless, all interpretative comments and recommendations included
in the software are based on the most recent and relevant scientific literature, ensuring
that the guidance offered aligns with current best practices.
Future Opportunities and Potential Impact
As a modular software platform, EOTRH Watch is designed to evolve in parallel with
emerging advances in veterinary science. Future iterations could incorporate new
preventive strategies, as emphasized by Siebert (2024), who calls for further research into
the aetiology and risk factors associated with EOTRH. The integration of well-defined
preventive protocols could shift the role of the software from primarily supporting
diagnosis and treatment planning to promoting early intervention and disease prevention.

Additionally, the integration of a local patient database could enable veterinarians to store
and review diagnostic histories over time, facilitating longitudinal follow-up. Such a
feature could support the detection of progression trends and allow for the introduction
of automated alerts recommending when to perform follow-up assessments. As more
clinical data is incorporated, the performance of the automatic diagnostic layer could also
be progressively optimized, resulting in more accurate and individualized assessments.
Another promising avenue is the development of equine-specific classification systems
for resorptive lesions. In human dentistry, the widely adopted Andreasen classification
(2007) distinguishes seven types of tooth resorption based on radiographic appearance.
This system has already been applied to dogs (Peralta et al., 2010) and tentatively adapted
for horses by Henry et al. (2017), who identified external replacement and external
inflammatory resorption as the most prevalent forms in EOTRH.
However, to date, no resorptive lesion classification system has been specifically
developed or validated for equine dentistry. Implementing a truly equine-specific
classification into the software could significantly enhance its diagnostic specificity by
allowing a more accurate categorization of resorptive lesions.
Beyond its diagnostic capabilities, EOTRH Watch serves a pivotal role in elevating the
visibility of Equine Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption and Hypercementosis (EOTRH).
This increased awareness not only facilitates improved welfare outcomes for horses
suffering from this painful condition but also stimulates further research into its etiology,
progression, and treatment options. EOTRH Watch encourages the veterinary community
to prioritize this condition, ultimately leading to advancements in preventive strategies
and therapeutic interventions
Finally, an important area for future exploration is the innovative use of digital image
analysis based on two-dimensional entropy measures. EOTRH Watch represents the first
veterinary application of this method, which has been primarily used in human medicine
for the detection of pathological texture changes in imaging. This work therefore opens
new avenues for applying entropy-based tools not only to the diagnosis of EOTRH, but
potentially to other dental pathologies in equine patients. The successful adaptation of
such computational techniques illustrates the potential for crossover between human and
veterinary diagnostic technologies, and highlights the growing role of automated tools in
advancing evidence-based equine dentistry.

Equine Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption and Hypercementosis (EOTRH) is a progressive,
painful, and often underdiagnosed dental disease that predominantly affects geriatric
horses. Despite its high prevalence and severe welfare implications, EOTRH continues to
be overlooked in many clinical contexts due to the absence of early, standardized, and
accessible diagnostic tools. Characterized by a destructive cycle of odontoclastic
resorption and reactive hypercementosis, the condition severely compromises dental
integrity and quality of life in affected horses. To date, tooth extraction remains the only
effective treatment for advanced cases, further underscoring the importance of early
detection.

In response to this clinical need, the present work has led to the development of EOTRH
Watch, an innovative, modular software designed to support veterinarians in the diagnosis
and monitoring of EOTRH. By integrating a structured clinical assessment layer, a
radiographic staging module, and an automated digital analysis tool based on entropy
metrics (DistEn2D), the software offers a comprehensive framework that enhances
diagnostic consistency, supports clinical decision-making, and promotes evidence-based
practice.
Although the software has certain limitations—such as a restricted dataset, the absence
of validated extraction criteria, and the need for an equine-specific classification of
resorptive lesions—it represents an important step forward in the digitalization of equine
dentistry. Its design prioritizes accessibility, enabling use by both specialists and general
practitioners across diverse clinical settings.
Beyond its diagnostic utility, EOTRH Watch plays a pivotal role in raising awareness of
this debilitating condition, encouraging earlier interventions and contributing to improved
welfare outcomes. The project also lays the groundwork for future developments,
including the integration of preventive strategies, local databases for longitudinal followup, and the refinement of diagnostic algorithms through clinical feedback.
In conclusion, EOTRH Watch demonstrates the feasibility and value of combining clinical
insight with digital innovation to address one of the most painful and underrecognized
dental conditions in horses. As equine veterinary medicine continues to evolve, tools like
this will be essential in bridging the gap between research and practice, and in ensuring
that geriatric equine patients receive the timely, compassionate, and informed care they
deserve.
