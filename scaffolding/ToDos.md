## ‚úÖ Diagnostic Analysis Components

- [X] Implementation of three-layer analysis system:
  - [X] Layer 1: Digital image analysis using texture algorithms
    - [X] Image preprocessing techniques
    - [X] ROI-based texture analysis with EntropyHub
    - [X] Calculation of Distance Entropy (DistEn) metrics
  - [X] Layer 2: Clinical signs assessment
    - [X] Scoring system for fistules
    - [X] Scoring system for gingival recession
    - [X] Scoring system for bulbous appearance
    - [X] Scoring system for gingivitis
    - [X] Scoring system for bite angle
  - [X] Layer 3: Radiographic signs assessment
    - [X] Scoring system for affected teeth
    - [X] Scoring system for absent teeth
    - [X] Scoring system for tooth shape
    - [X] Scoring system for tooth structure
    - [X] Scoring system for tooth surface
- [X] Integrated scoring algorithm with configurable weights
- [X] Classification system based on thresholds
- [X] Interpretative comments for each diagnostic category

## ‚úÖ User Interface Enhancements

- [X] Development of diagnostic results thermometer visualization
- [X] Loading screens with progress indicators
- [X] Tabbed interface for clinical vs radiographic data
- [X] Mobile-responsive design
- [X] Score breakdown visualization with color-coded bars
- [X] Tool tooltips and user guidance
- [X] Dynamic form validation

## üîÑ Ongoing Improvements & Future Enhancements

- [X] Consider interpretative comments that have been adapted for each state
- [X] Show the score corresponding to each sign in the forms
- [X] Add a "None" option to each question in the form
- [?] Remove final interpretative score - the software should only provide interpretation for each layer without a final interpretation (awaiting client approval)

## üìä Performance Optimization

- [X] Image preprocessing optimization
- [X] Canvas rendering performance improvements
- [X] Asynchronous processing for computational tasks
- [ ] Server-side caching for faster repeated analyses
- [ ] Optimize mobile performance

## üì¶ Packaging

- [ ] Create standalone executable for Windows users
- [ ] Develop Docker container for easy deployment
- [ ] Implement web-based deployment option with cloud hosting
- [ ] Create installation packages for different operating systems
- [ ] Develop auto-update mechanism for desktop versions

## üìù Documentation & Training

- [X] In-application tooltips and guidance
- [ ] README with installation instructions
