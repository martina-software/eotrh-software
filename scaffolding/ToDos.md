# ANNOTATIONS TO CONSIDER FOR FUTURE CHANGES

- Consider interpretative comments that I've changed for each state
- Show the score corresponding to each sign in the forms
- Add a "None" option to each question in the form
- Remove final interpretative score - the software should only provide interpretation for each layer without a final interpretation
